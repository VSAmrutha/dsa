<!-- Create a vanilla js application that consumes the https://fakestoreapi.com/products?sort=asc API and displays a
   list of products in ascending order based on price. The application should also include a 
   dropdown to allow the user to change the sorting of the products between ascending and descending. 
   When the user changes the sorting order, the application should update the query parameter value and 
   fetch the products with the new sorting order. -->
